# Mall-Customer-Segmentation---Kaggle
Author@sayeed

Customer segmentation concepts i.e market basket analysis is demonstrated by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm)
The dataset has 5 columns CustomerID, Age, Gender,Annual Income, Spending Score
The dataset is modelled using kmeans.
Modelled data is viualized.
First Gender vs Shopping Score is plotted but we see there is not much effect on Score based on Gender
so, visualization between Annual Income vs Shopping Score is done which shows the dependencies.
